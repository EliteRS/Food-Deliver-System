For the features I did NOT include the following: 
Customer/User
- Select time and date for delivery
- Update time and date for delivery
- Instead of "Cancel delivery" user can delete orders

Admin
- Create available schedules for delivery
- Instead of "Delete delivery schedules" admin can delete orders



In the Use Case Diagram:
- There is no Profile Page
- In the "Item List page" or in my new Use case it is called Menu Page. 
  Users can now select or add to cart products.
- Also in Order Page or Cart Page, users can now Update products from the cart
- I also added two features for Admin which admin can search or view users
